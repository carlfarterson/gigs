# WhalerDAO

## Summary

### Audit
#### [Repo](TODO)
* I formally audited WhalerDAO's
 [tree-contracts](https://github.com/whalerdao/tree-contracts)
 for three weeks (October 10-31, 2020) weeks and found no exploits.
* [Audit](TODO)

### Saving the Reserve
#### [Repo](TODO)
After TREE was deployed, we quickly found that the short interval between rebalances harmed TREE holders and distributed more profits to arb bots than to charity. We had to "trick" our reserve to send the $176k worth of DAI to an intermediary wallet, where it would stay until TREE v2 was launched on [X](TODO: link to v2 blog post)
